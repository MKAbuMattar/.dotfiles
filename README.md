# My `.dotfiles` Arch Linux Profile

Welcome to my Arch Linux profile! This is a collection of my personal configuration files and scripts that I use to customize my Arch Linux system. This repository is meant to be a reference for myself, but feel free to use any of the files in this repository for your own system.
